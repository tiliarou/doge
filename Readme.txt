# Setup
- Install Python 3 and Nut's dependencies (see nut/README.mb)
  - Run the cmd found there that starts with: pip3 install ...
- Install NodeJS LTS / 10 from https://nodejs.org/en/ (or `brew install node@10` on Mac) and restart your computer
- Set your games folder root in /nut/conf/nut.conf (paths.scan, use / instead of \ even on Windows, ex: C:/games)
- Run start.bat (Windows) or start.sh (Mac/Linux)
- Visit the url you see in your web browser

# Credits

- Thanks to blawar, morrison22, DBZTrunks, and more!

# How To
- If you're having trouble, make sure Nut runs fine on it's own (don't run it without any params because it will rename your files)
  - run: nut.py -s
- Update checking is powered by using a db url that has update info
  - Add any db urls you want to titleUrls in nut/conf/nut.conf
- To see which Switch games you have installed, run digableinc/tinfoil (dz) on your Switch, from:
  https://github.com/digableinc/tinfoil
  - Make sure it's configured to connect to the nut server on your computer
- To see pictures in the Grid View mode, you must enable EShop scraping / SCRAPE_ESHOP in doge.config.json
  - This will take a while, so be patient
- To change your login:
  - For the Nut server login, change /nut/conf/users.conf (and make sure to add a valid admin login into doge.config.json's NUT_USER/NUT_PASS)
  - For Doge, see doge.config.json's USERS section
- If you have a URL that you can make send you a notification, set it into URL_NOTIFY_NEW_FILES
  - %msg will be replaced with a message about which games were found (up to a few at once)
  - Pushbullet/etc gives you a URL like this so you can get notifications on your phone
- Rename your Switches that show up in the dropdown:
  - See SWITCH_ALIASES in the config to get from serial to alias
- Auto Unlocking just runs nut.py --unlock-all, so if it's not working, run that yourself from the command line and check for errors
  - You will need a populated keys.txt, which is not included
  - Make sure you set where you want files to go in nut.conf's "paths", by default they will be moved into sub-folders)
